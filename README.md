In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# If you used any particular libraries why did you choose them?
- Material UI - Used  for design components
- Axios - For api calling

# Did you have any challenges and if so, how did you overcome them?
- A bit of struggle because i wasn't able to find the api that supports search for pokemons listing so that functionality is implemented but doesn't work due to api limitation.

# Did you add any extra features?
- Not any specifically.

# If you had more time, what else would you implement?
- I could've definetly worked a bit more to improve the UI/UX stuff.
